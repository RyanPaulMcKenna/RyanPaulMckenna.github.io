Since 2016 I have been finding simple solutions to complex problems.
I have worked in Scientific Computing, Machine Learning, Embedded Software Engineering and Robotics.
Currently I am pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at The University of York, my research is focussed on
the intersection between Soft-Robotics and Robotic Deformable Object Manipulation. I want to help make robots
safer, cheaper and better for working around people.

Please see my Europass resume below.
